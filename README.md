## My process

The process was very straightforward. I started by writing out the stucture of my HTML. I then created a CSS stylesheet
and broke down the styling of elements one piece at a time using the flexbox layout model, while following the
mobile-first approach. To complete the layout, I then proceeded to write the media queries for the desktop design. After
the design was completed, I proceeded to add the logic and interactivity of the page using JavaScript.

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox layout model
-   Media queries
-   JavaScript programming language
